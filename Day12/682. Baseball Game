class Solution:
    def calPoints(self, operations: List[str]) -> int:
        stack = []
        final = 0
        for i in range(len(operations)):
            if operations[i] == '+' and len(stack)>=2:
                stack.append(stack[-1] + stack[-2])
            elif operations[i] == 'D':
                stack.append(stack[-1]*2)
            elif operations[i] == 'C':
                stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(int(operations[i]))
        return sum(stack)

This was a pretty straightforward question and was easy so solved it in the first try.
