This was my first attempt at the code and I had 83/100 test cases pass, I am going to verify what went wrong and then try to make my code even better.
I guess this is completely wrong because I tried to make the code better by making some changes and it went to 70/100, I am going to try again until I get a solution on my own and after 20-30 mins if I am still yet to come up with anything I am looking at the solutions.
