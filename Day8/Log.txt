We will strat of todays day with chapter 4, Recursion
The factorial function, is usually denoted as follows: n!, now this equates to 1*2*3**.....n-1*n.
In order to do this you can use a for loop to simple loop and multiply with itself increementing the value by 1 every single loop, or u use recursion ,
using recursion , we call the function over and over again until the condition is met just like in a for loop.
def factorial(n):
    if n==0:
       return 1
    else:
       return n*factorial(n-1)
