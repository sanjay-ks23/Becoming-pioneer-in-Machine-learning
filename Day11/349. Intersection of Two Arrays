This is my code that I intially typed in and submitted :
class Solution:
    def intersection(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        for i in range(len(nums1)):
            if nums1[i] in nums2 and nums1[i] not in result:
                result.append(nums1[i])
        return result

but apprently there is a more optimized way to solve the same and I looked at the solution, it was to use the & symbol and find the intersection.
