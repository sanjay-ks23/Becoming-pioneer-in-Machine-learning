class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        pattern = []
        for i in range(len(haystack)):
            pattern = haystack[i:i+len(needle)]
            pattern = ''.join(pattern)
            if pattern == needle:
                return i
            else:
                pattern = []
        return -1
        
This was my solution, it took my some time as this is my first time trying string based code, but the complexity of it was O(N*M)
now onto the more efficient solution by refering to the solutions
