Today we will start with stack, queue and deque and make sure we work problems in both chapters Array(List) and today's topics.
We will begin with content of chapter 6 and when I get distracted I might  solve problems if not I will stop after reading the whole chapter, and the chapters is around 20 pages, so shouldn't take much .

STACKS, QUEUES AND DEQUEUES:
I completed this chapter in the book tried to write the class i.e, ADT for each of them in my note book.

And after that I solved 8 easy leetcode list problems.
Tommorow will be starting linked list and solving problems in all these topics that I have done till now.
