We are so close to the end of this book , we should complete it quickly as possible.
Don't forget I still have a around two hours from yesterday. Rounding up to a total of 8 hrs today.I dont know if I will be able to complete it but I willl give it my best shot.
Time:  Date:
Also I forgot to mention I am stopping this book with the 44th chapter, because after going through the rest of them, I dont think in my current situtation I will be needing it, so I think I can complete the book by today and start with the data structures book.
Also I would like you to know that in the next book there are a lot of content for each chapter, around 50 pages, so be ready for a lot of typing.

If you need motivation just remember, thi sis just like working out, initally it doesnt't look like much and as you get deep into the concepts you will surprise yourself with what you can do and how your perception and other perception of you changes.By just being consistent.
Hope you don't forget this , similar to sculpting.
