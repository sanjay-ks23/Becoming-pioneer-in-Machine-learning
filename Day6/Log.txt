We are so close to the end of this book , we should complete it quickly as possible.
Don't forget I still have a around two hours from yesterday. Rounding up to a total of 8 hrs today.I dont know if I will be able to complete it but I willl give it my best shot.
Time:  Date:
Also I forgot to mention I am stopping this book with the 44th chapter, because after going through the rest of them, I dont think in my current situtation I will be needing it, so I think I can complete the book by today and start with the data structures book.
Also I would like you to know that in the next book there are a lot of content for each chapter, around 50 pages, so be ready for a lot of typing.
